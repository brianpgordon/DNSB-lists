## Notes
This is a service provided by an individual, not a company or government.

While IPv4 and IPv6 address are posted for each server, they require DNSCrypt
to communicate with them over UDP/53. This makes them incompatible with the DNS
Benchmark.

The availablility for some of the servers change over time. Due to the need for 
upkeep, these will not be included in the `unfiltered.ini` file. Changes are
posted at https://www.dnscry.pt/news/.

All servers provide the same type of service, so files are divide by server
location. Files are named with the ISO 3166 country code and the city as
provided by the site.

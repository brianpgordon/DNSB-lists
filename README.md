# DNS Nameserver Lists for GRC's DNS Benchmark

This repo is a collection of INI files that can be imported into [GRC's DNS Benchmarking utility](https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm).

These lists work with the current v1 benchmark and the upcoming v2 benchmark that is currently under development.

## Usage

### List Organization

Lists are organized based on the service provider and the type of filtering that is provided. Just download the lists you want or checkout the entire project to get a copy of them all.

### Importing

Depending on your needs, you may want to start with a cleared list.

Using the "Add/Remove" window, select "Add .INI file Nameservers" and select the INI file to import. Multiple files can be added before running the benchmark.
